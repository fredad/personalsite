            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p id="hi"> Hi!</p>
            <p id="main"> My name is Freda. I am web designer in the making and a research analyst at Fox Broadcasting Company. I found my passion for web design a really long time ago. How long ago? Well, letâ€™s just say I can still remember how to use Microsoft
            FrontPage. :) <br>
            <br>
            Prior to my current position, I worked in an international production company in Los Angeles while pursuing my master degree in Public Relations at University of Southern California. Palm trees and sunny beaches are unforgettable, but nothing compares to the New York city skyline. After a brief trip to New York in 2016, I immediately made the decision to move here.<br>
            <br>
            Born and raised in Shanghai, I have also lived in Melbourne and Barcelona before moving to the US. The multi-cultural experience not only helped me learn to understand and appreciate different cultures but also made me realize the importance of the tech industry around the world.<br>
            <br>
            I love traveling and I have been to 20 countries and counting. When I am not at work, you can find me in all kinds of local restaurants in New York searching for the best treat for my taste buds. I also enjoy going to concerts and events and am decently knowledgeable of all the happenings in the city.</p>
